# 8-block-puzzle

A Puzzle utilizing Java Swing that consists of 8 square pieces (numbered 1-8) and a blank piece.
Clicking a piece that neighbors the blank square moves it at the blank’s position. A “Moves” counter 
counts the number of moves in the current game, and when all pieces are in the correct order (1-8) a victory message appears.
